# Useful Powershell Profile(s)

These are Powershell profile files I have accumulated and tweaked to my personal liking.

  - Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
  - PSProfileExample.ps1

### Version
1.0

### Information

* [Richard Hollon] - My website!
* [Powershell] - Windows PowerShellÂ® is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the .NET Framework, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.

And of course my Powershell profile scripts are open source on my [git-repo-url] on my GitHub.

**Free Software, Hell Yeah!**
